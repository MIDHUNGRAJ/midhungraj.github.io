# Linear Regression Explained

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and understand the relationship between variables:
- One or more independent variables (X)
- One dependent variable (Y)

Linear regression finds a line that best fits the dataset. This line helps predict the dependent variable (Y) based on the independent variable(s) (X).

## Use Cases

1. Predicting House Prices
2. Stock Price Prediction
3. Medical Cost Estimation
4. Sales Forecasting

## Key Points

- Y: the values you want to predict
- X: the values used to make the prediction

## Mathematical Interpretation

For **simple linear regression** (with one independent variable), the equation is:

```
Y = wX + b
```

Where:
* **w** (weight or slope) represents the change in Y for each unit change in X.
* **X** is the independent variable.
* **b** (bias or intercept) is the value of Y when X is 0.

In more complex cases with multiple independent variables, this equation can be extended to:

```
Y = w1X1 + w2X2 + ... + wnXn + b
```

This is called **multivariate linear regression**.

## Basic Example

Let’s start with a simple example of linear regression using a dataset with one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).

### Code Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the dataset
X = np.array([1, 2])  # Independent variable
Y = np.array([300, 500])  # Dependent variable (target values)

# Choose arbitrary values for weight (w) and bias (b)
w = 200  # Weight
b = 100  # Bias

# Calculate predicted Y values using the linear equation Y = wX + b
predicted_Y = w * X + b

# Print predicted values for clarity
for i in range(len(X)):
    print(f"Predicted Y for X={X[i]}: {predicted_Y[i]}")
```

### Explanation

In this example, we are manually defining the weight (\(w\)) and bias (\(b\)) of the linear equation:

\[
Y = wX + b
\]

### Predictions

Using the given values for \(w\) and \(b\), we can compute the predicted values of \(Y\):

- For \(X = 1\):
  \[
  Y = (200 \times 1) + 100 = 300
  \]
- For \(X = 2\):
  \[
  Y = (200 \times 2) + 100 = 500
  \]

These calculations yield the predicted values of \(Y\) that perfectly match our actual values in the dataset.

### Important Note

This example is very basic and uses arbitrary values for \(w\) and \(b\) to illustrate the concept of linear regression. In real-world applications, we typically use a cost function (like mean squared error) to optimize these parameters based on the data, allowing the model to learn the best-fit line automatically.

### Visualization

To visualize how well our predicted values align with the actual data points, we can create a scatter plot and draw the regression line:

```python
# Visualization
plt.scatter(X, Y, marker="X", c="g", label="Actual Values")
plt.plot(X, predicted_Y, label="Predicted Line", color='r')
plt.title('Linear Regression Example')
plt.xlabel('Independent Variable (X)')
plt.ylabel('Dependent Variable (Y)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Interpretation of the Visualization

In the visualization:

<img src="/images/ploted_image.png" alt="image" width="500" height="300">

- **Green Markers (Actual Values)**: These represent the actual data points in our dataset.
- **Red Line (Predicted Line)**: This line represents our model's predictions based on the chosen \(w\) and \(b\). It shows how well the model fits the actual data.

## scikit-learn implementation 

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
X = np.array([[1], [2]])  # Features should be 2D for sklearn
Y = np.array([300, 500])  # Target values

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, Y)

# Predict values
predicted_Y = model.predict(X)

# Plotting
plt.scatter(X, Y, marker="X", c="g", label="Actual Value")
plt.plot(X, predicted_Y, label="Our prediction")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```

## Implementing Linear Regression from Scratch

Let's implement simple linear regression from scratch using Python:

### The Cost Function

To assess how well our model fits the data, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function:

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2
$$

Where:
- $$ n $$ is the number of samples.
- $$ y_{i} $$ is the actual value.
- $$ \hat{y}_{i} $$ is the predicted value.

### Gradient Descent

To optimize our model, we employ the gradient descent algorithm, which minimizes the cost function by iteratively adjusting the weights and bias. The update rules for the weights and bias are given by:

$$
\beta_j = \beta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial MSE}{\partial \beta_j}
$$

Where:
- $$ \beta_j $$ represents the weights (or bias).
- $$ \alpha $$ is the learning rate, controlling the size of the steps taken towards the minimum.

### Code Implementation

Let's dive into the code for our Linear Regression model.

```python
import numpy as np

class LinearRegression():
    def __init__(self, learning_rate, max_iter):
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.max_iter = max_iter

    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        
        self.weights = np.random.rand(n_features)
        self.bias = 0

        for _ in range(self.max_iter):
            y_pred = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
            dw = (1 / n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
            db = (1 / n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)

            self.weights -= self.lr * dw
            self.bias -= self.lr * db

    def predict(self, X):
        return np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=1, noise=10, random_state=42)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    reg = LinearRegression(learning_rate=0.01, max_iter=1000)
    reg.fit(X=X_train, y=y_train)
    y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)

    print(f"{mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred):.3f}")

```

This implementation uses gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error and find the optimal weights and bias.

## Using Scikit-learn for Linear Regression

Now, let's implement the same linear regression using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=1, noise=10, random_state=42)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))

plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Linear Regression Dataset')
plt.show()
```

This scikit-learn implementation provides a more streamlined approach with built-in features like train-test splitting and model evaluation metrics.

Both implementations demonstrate how to create a linear regression model, fit it to data, make predictions, and visualize the results. The scikit-learn version offers additional functionality and is generally more efficient for real-world applications.
